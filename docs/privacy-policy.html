<h2><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></h2>
<p><em>Last Updated: 20/11/2025</em></p>

<p>This privacy statement (“Privacy Policy”) explains how “Escapy” (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects and uses information.</p>
<p>We do not sell or share your information with third parties.</p>

<h3><strong>Personal Information</strong></h3>
<p>Escapy uses Firebase services to authenticate users. As part of this process, Firebase stores your email address and a unique user identifier (UID). These elements are required for secure access to your account and to link your games, history, and preferences.</p>
<p>We do not store additional personal information beyond what is required for account authentication and normal app operation.</p>

<h3><strong>Game and App Data</strong></h3>
<p>To enable gameplay, we store game-related data such as created games, game state, messages, clues, timers, and statistics. This data is only used inside the application and is not shared externally.</p>

<h3><strong>Non-Personal Information</strong></h3>
<p>We may collect anonymized technical data such as device type, operating system version, crash logs, and diagnostic information. These help us improve app stability, fix bugs, and understand app usage patterns.</p>
<p>Third-party services such as Google Crashlytics or Firebase Analytics may process this anonymized data on our behalf.</p>

<h3><strong>Account Deletion</strong></h3>
<p>You can request the complete deletion of your account. When your account is deleted, all associated personal data and game-related information will be permanently removed from our systems. This action is irreversible.</p>

<h3><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></h3>
<p>Escapy does not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age required by local data protection laws for independent online consent. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has created an account without your approval, you may contact us to request removal of the account.</p>

<h3><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></h3>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. You are encouraged to review this page for any modifications. Changes become effective when posted here.</p>
